TODO/IDEAS:

- [ ] Turf API
   - [ ] Check current Money
   - [ ] Withdraw from bank
   - [ ] Parse turf Health and Heal
   - [ ] Purchase turf extensions if they're less than 3
- [ ] Server/client API with server
   - [ ] Keep track of statistiscs, replace GM_setVar() etc
- [ ] Parses all invite forum invites and stores them in tampermonkey or forty7.guru potatobase
- [ ] (every 20-40 seconds) Parse news/fights (or check Turf Health from Turf list directly), trigger CheckTurf()
   - [ ] CheckTurf() clicks on every turf in attack list or main  turf list and parses health, and heals
   - [ ] Possibly investigate Bank API
- [ ] (every 5-10 minutes) Check missions page and if we have enough energy, then do the best mission
   - [ ] possibly do same thing for attack list (close players list, Mob or search) and automatically farm
